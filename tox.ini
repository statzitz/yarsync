# tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.
# To run for a specific version:
# tox -e py37

[tox]
envlist = py37, py38, py39, py310, py311, py312, py313, pypy3
# We need this in order to test end of life python version e.g py36, py37
# requires = virtualenv < 20.22.0
# Tested on Python 3.6 on another host, because of this bug with libffi:
# https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues/10429
